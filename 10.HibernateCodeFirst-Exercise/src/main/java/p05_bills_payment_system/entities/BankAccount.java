    /*
    A SWIFT code may be of eight to eleven digits and has the following components:

    - The first four characters are used as the bank codes. Only letters can be used.
    - The next two characters, only letters, are to describe or give the country code.
    - The next two characters can be a mix of both numbers and letters. These are used for location-based codes.
    - The last three characters of the code can be digits and letters, and are optional.
    These last three characters in a SWIFT code are used to give details about the branch code.

    A good example of a SWIFT code would be the CommBankâ€™s code- CTBAAU2S
